# Getting Started

\tableofcontents

Welcome to Hermes! A multi-purpose library that may (hopefully) help you quickly set up a 
`C++`/`CUDA` project by providing you a bunch of auxiliary tools and structures. 

> Please check the [build](1_build_and_install.md) and [link](2_linking.md) instructions to learn 
> how to include `hermes` in your project.

## File Structure
Although most of `hermes` classes live in a single namespace, you will find the files organized 
in folders, such as: `geometry`, `data_structures`, `storage`, etc.
